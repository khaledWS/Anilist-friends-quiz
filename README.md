# Anilist-friends-quiz
python code for a discord bot that Quizzes discord users on their friends anime rating, this is a fun lil project that i worked on

Note that this code was written in the replit.com.io online code enviroment and uses its library's and key-value based database 

Anilist is an anime platform for tracking, sharing and discovering Anime and manga
users can track what they watched give the anime they watched a score and share it with other Anilist friends , its a really good platform with a great UI and API

The Anilist Api is a GraphQL Api https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs

the Way my bot works is after using the command $play it would pick a random Anilist acount from a list of accounts that was added by the users then pick a random anime with a score > 0 to ask the question "Who Rated the Anime xxxxxxx a score of xxx" anyone online can particiapte and the answers have to be with the names of the Anilist accounts that the are in the list
